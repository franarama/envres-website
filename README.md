# envres-website
This website uses HTML, CSS, and PHP to create a reservation booking system for server environments. This was a work assignment (Co-op Fall/Summer 2016).

## Prerequisites
These instructions are for Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. A text editor is required for writing code (I use Komodo, but you can use whatever you'd like such as Notepad++). A web server is required to run PHP based programs so we will install a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. The website stores and retrieves information from databases so we will install and use phpMyAdmin (a web interface).


I used the following resource to download LAMP stack for Ubuntu:
```

```

and this resource for downloading phpMyAdmin for Ubuntu:
```

```
